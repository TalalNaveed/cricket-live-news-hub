## üìù Problem & Solution Statement

###  Problem
Cricket fans often check live scores, but finding **relevant and up-to-date news** about the teams currently playing requires visiting multiple websites.
This makes it time-consuming to stay informed about both **match progress** and **related news updates** in one place.

### Solution
I want to help **cricket fans** to **see live matches and instantly access recent news about the teams playing**  
by combining:  
- **CricAPI** ‚Üí provides real-time information about ongoing cricket matches (teams, venue, status).  
- **NewsAPI** ‚Üí provides the latest news articles and headlines about those teams.  

By merging these two APIs, the program allows users to:  
1. **View current matches** with status updates.  
2. **Choose a team** they are interested in.  
3. **Get recent news headlines and links** for that team, without leaving the app.  

This creates a **one-stop tool** where fans can follow matches **and** stay updated with media coverage in real time.

The flowchart uses **CricAPI** and **NewsAPI** to solve the problem of connecting **live cricket matches** with **recent news updates**.

---

#### CricAPI (currentMatches)
- Provides **real-time cricket data**.  
- Returns a list of ongoing or upcoming matches, including:  
  - **Teams**  
  - **Venue**  
  - **Match status**  

---

#### List Live Matches
- The program displays the matches fetched from CricAPI.  
- This allows the user to see which games are **currently active**.  

---

####  User Chooses a Team
- The user selects **one of the teams** they are interested in.  
- This choice becomes the **search query** for NewsAPI.  

---

####  NewsAPI (everything endpoint)
- Takes the selected **team name** as input.  
- Searches for the **latest news articles** related to that team, such as:  
  - Match previews  
  - Interviews  
  - Recent performances  

---

#### Latest News Headlines (Output)
- The program outputs a short list of the **most recent headlines**.  
- Each result includes:  
  - **Title**  
  - **URL link** to the full article
